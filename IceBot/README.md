Welcome to IceBot, the auto call bot for IceBar

Before you use this program,
This is for python to run the commands that change the input devices via commandline
How to get working:
1. run Install-Module -Name AudioDeviceCmdlets -Scope CurrentUser on Powershell
2. pip install -r requirements.txt 
2.5. pip install -r SAS-Scripts/requirements.txt if in VSCode
3. pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
4. Download ffmpeg 
Go to the ffmpeg install page, select your device, then select gyan.dev
https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ - ffmpeg-git-full.7z
Download it, go to bin, and copy ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe to the same folder as the main script (root folder if in VSCode, or same folder trial and error)
This both for the audio transcribing thing to work and the audio editing to work
5. Setup config
6. Get voicelines (Check other folders for examples)
7. Wallah !!
